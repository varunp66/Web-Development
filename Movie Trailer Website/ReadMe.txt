## Udacity Project 1: Movie Trailer Website


In this project we have build a Website where the user can 
watch the Trailers of all my favourite movies just on one 
page.


## Project Content:

On download/ opening the project it should consist following files:
- media.py
- entertainment.py
- fresh_tomatoes.py
- ReadMe.txt


## How to run the project:

- If we have python installed then we can simply open the 
  entertainment_center.py by right clicking on it and then
  edit with IDLE and can run it.
- We can also run it on some IDE which supports Python.


## Woring:

The project consist of three files media.py, entertainment_center.py
and fresh_tomatoes.py. The .py extension indicates that all are
python files, written in python language.

The media.py runs the movies on the web browser. It initializes
the several content that has been specified in entertainment_center.py
and runs the movie trailer on the browser.

The entertainment_center.py got all the list of the movies whose trailer
we want to show on the browser. It takes the init method from media.py
which helps to run the movies on the browser.

The fresh_tomatoes.py is where we have desing our web page using
HTML, CSS etc. Here we have add several features like animation, color,
size of the image. No matter what size of image you will upload it will
always match the size of the other images on the page.


## Modifications

- Changed the background color of the web page.
- Also change the color of the movie tile when we hover cursor on it.
